# Extract Metadata

## Installing dependencies

If installing directly from the Git repository, you will need to install dependencies
using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Within the ExtractMetadata/ directory,
run the following:

```
$ composer install
```

This will install dependencies in a vendor/ directory.

## Custom extractors and mappers

Modules can extend this module to add their own custom extractors and mappers.
