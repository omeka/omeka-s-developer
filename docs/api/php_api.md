# PHP API

From within Omeka's PHP environment there are three ways to make API requests: directly,
using the API manager service, and indirectly, using the API controller plugin or
the API view helper.

## API Manager

You can perform API operations directly using Omeka's API manager. The API manager
is responsible for authorizing the user, initializing the API request, performing
the operation on the resource, and finalizing the API response. (Note that not all
resources implement every API operation.)

You can access the API manager directly using the service locator (should you have
access to the service locator, of course). Once you have the manager you can perform
the following API operations:

- `search($resource, $data, $options)`: search resources by query
- `read($resource, $id, $data, $options)`: read a resource by ID
- `create($resource, $data, $fileData, $options)`: create a resource
- `batchCreate($resource, $data, $fileData, $options)`: batch create resources
- `update($resource, $id, $data, $fileData, $options)`: update a resource by ID
- `batchUpdate($resource, $ids, $data, $fileData, $options)`: batch update resources by IDs
- `delete($resource, $id, $data, $options)`: delete a resource by ID
- `batchDelete($resource, $ids, $data, $options)`: batch delete resources by IDs

The operations mostly reuse a small handful of the same parameters:

- `$resource` is the resource name (`items`, `media`, etc.) and is required for any
  operation as the first parameter
- `$id` is the ID of the specific resource to retrieve or act on, used for read, update,
  and delete operations. Usually this is just an integer ID, though where appropriate you
  can pass an array here specifying that you're looking up the resource with a different
  piece or pieces of data. For example, sites and pages are often looked up by slug, and
  so can use `['slug' => 'a-slug']` as the ID parameter.
- `$data` is an optional array of API request parameters. Some operations like read
  rarely use this parameter, but for others it's the most important: for search, it holds
  the [query](api_reference.md#api-search-parameters); for create and update it holds the
  data being set to the resource.
- `$fileData` is an optional array of file data, used for create and update operations when
  a file is being uploaded as part of the operation. When used, `$fileData` typically comes
  getting the uploaded file data from the Laminas MVC: `$this->getRequest()->getFiles()->toArray();`
- `$options` is an optional array of [API request options](api_reference.md#api-request-options).

Each operation will return an API [response object](#responses) containing the
requested data and other relevant information. You can get the resultant
representation by calling `getContent()` on the response. For example, to get an
item with an ID of 123:

```php-inline
// Where $services is Omeka's service locator object.
$api = $services->get('Omeka\ApiManager');
$response = $api->read('items', 123);
$itemRepresentation = $response->getContent();
```

## Controller plugin

You can access the API in your controllers using the API controller plugin,
accessible within a controller by calling `$this->api()`. The plugin
has every operation that the API manager has, plus an additional one
for convenience:

- `searchOne($resource, $data, $options)`: search for one resource by query

For example, to get an item representation via a route parameter in a typical show
action:

```php-inline
public function showAction()
{
    $itemRepresentation = $this->api()->read('items', $this->params('id'))->getContent();
    $view = new ViewModel;
    $view->setVariable('item', $item);
    return $view;
}
```

## View helper

You can access the API manager in your views using the API view helper,
accessible within a view by calling `$this->api()`. The helper only has the
`search()`, `searchOne()`, and `read()` operations. This is prevent operations
that change state from being executed in the view layer.

For example, to get an item in a view template:

```php
<?php $itemRepresentation = $this->api()->read('items', 123); ?>
```

## Responses

All API operations return a response object of class `Omeka\Api\Response`. The
main method of use is `getContent()`, which returns the actual content that
was requested. For `read`, this is a single value, while `search` will have content
that is an array.

By default, the values returned by `getContent()` will be
[representation](representations.md) objects, suitable for use in views
and controllers.

Another method is useful for `search` specifically: `getTotalResults()` returns
the total number of resources that matched the given query, even those beyond
limits or pagination specified in the request. This "total" value is often
presented to the user or used for things like pagination to calculate how many
pages of results exist.

## Errors

The API methods throw exceptions for error cases. These exceptions all implement
the `Omeka\Api\Exception\ExceptionInterface` interface. Common exceptions
include:

- `Omeka\Api\Exception\NotFoundException`: when an request for an operation
  like `read` or `update` specifies an ID that can't be found
- `Omeka\Api\Exception\PermissionDeniedException`: when the current user lacks
  the necessary level of permissions to fulfill the request
- `Omeka\Api\Exception\ValidationException`: when an `update` or `create`
  request specifies invalid data. The specific validation error messages are
  avaiable from the `getErrorStore()` method of the exception.

For the controller helper specifically, a Form object can be passed:
`$this->api($form)`, and if a validation error occurs, the helper will try to
automatically match up the returned error messages with their corresponding
form elements, so the user can see the errors in context, as well as showing
them as "flash" messages on the top of the screen.
